            <p className='text-light'>COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus, is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
                      It was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since spread globally, leading to a worldwide pandemic. 
                      Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.

      <h4 className='display-4'>HOW IT SPREADS</h4>
          <p className='text-light'>
The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.
